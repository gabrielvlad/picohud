An unobtrusive, player-readable information hud.

It rounds off and simplifies information to make it glanceable.

When a key (default left alt) is held, information text is shown, anchored to the top left of the screen. This includes:

 - Rounded Co-Ordinates
 - Facing Direction (Northeast etc.)
 - In-game Day and In-game Time - Rounded to the nearest half hour
   - As of 1.1, will show day in a seasonal format when [Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons) is installed
